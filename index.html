			<p>There are 26 cases with values ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000.</p>
			<p>You will be asked to pick a case. This is your case for the game.</p>
			<p>You will then eliminate a number of cases. Once done, the banker will<br>make you an offer to buy your case from you. You may choose Deal or<br>no Deal. </p>
			<p>This process then repeats.</p>
			<p>The game ends either when you make a deal or the last case will be eliminated.</p>
